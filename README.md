## About Me

I am a technical support analyst focused on providing a great customer experience. My work includes configuring network equipment, leading installations, analyzing networks to resolve issues, and working directly with customers to ensure their phone systems provide as much value as possible.

Lately, my learning has been focused on AI engineering. In April 2024, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University. During the program, I worked on projects using classical machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems. For example, I developed a sentiment analysis tool for financial news articles to assist stock traders and created a churn prediction model for subscription-based telecom companies.

Since graduating, Iâ€™ve shifted my focus to generative AI approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI Agents. Iâ€™m particularly interested in building solutions that help businesses extract value from their unstructured data. For instance, a generative AI-powered chatbot could read and understand company documentation, enabling it to quickly and accurately answer user questions.

As a practitioner in AI and data science, Iâ€™m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals to share ideas, collaborate on projects, or explore new opportunities. If our interests align, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect!
