## About Me

Iâ€™m an Applied Data Scientist with 8 years of experience studying AI and a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Data Science. At Votacall, a cloud VoIP provider, I lead the companyâ€™s AI initiatives and am laying the foundation for its AI-first product strategy.

My work includes:

- Delivering strategic AI market analysis, recommendations, and demos to executive leadership
- Leading evaluations of white-label voice AI agent platforms such as Synthflow and Vapi
- Developing a call reporting AI assistant using OpenAI's Python SDK, Gradio, MongoDB, and Pandas
- Creating and managing the VCon server pipeline to analyze call records from Netsapiens and store them in MongoDB

One of the most valuable things I do is evaluate AI systems using LLM-as-a-Judge and golden dataset techniques, and then translate those results into actionable insights for the business. If you're working on similar problems or just interested in AI for voice communications, feel free to connect. Iâ€™m excited to keep expanding my impact as a technical AI leader and continue building tools that power intelligent voice solutions.
